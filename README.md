# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains machine learning projects involving predicting if a person has insomnia in two ways. 
The repository has two folders: Insomnia - EEG and Insomnnia - Hypnogram.
The folder Insomnia - EEG contains code that predics if a person has insomni based on the overnight EEG recordings from at most 2 channels (C3 and C4).
The folder Insomnia-Hypnogram contains files that predict if a person has insomnia based on the hypnogram readings.
